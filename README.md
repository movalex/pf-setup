# pf-setup


## initial setup


copy the file /etc/[pf.conf](/etc/pf.conf) to `/etc/pf.conf`

copy the file /etc/pf.anchors/[emerging-threats](/etc/pf.anchors/emerging-threats) to `/etc/pf.anchors/emerging-threats`

copy /opt/pf/[update-et.sh](/opt/pf/update-et.sh) to the home dir of the user who will run the script or to `/opt/pf/update-et.sh`

make the script executable:

	$ chmod 540 /opt/pf/update-et.sh


run the update script to fetch the latest version of emerging-Block-IPs.txt:

	$ sudo /opt/pf/update-et.sh


alternatively you could execute the follwing commands in sequence:

	curl http://rules.emergingthreats.net/fwrules/emerging-Block-IPs.txt -o /tmp/emerging-Block-IPs.txt
	sudo cp /tmp/emerging-Block-IPs.txt /opt/pf
	sudo chmod 644 /opt/pf/emerging-Block-IPs.txt
	rm /tmp/emerging-Block-IPs.txt

    
test the config prior to rebooting:

	$ sudo pfctl -v -n -f /etc/pf.conf

    
load the config and enable the pf firewall:

	$ sudo pfctl -e -f /etc/pf.conf
